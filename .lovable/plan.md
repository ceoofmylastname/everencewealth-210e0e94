# Gmail Filter Setup Guide for Hans

## What We're Creating

A clean markdown reference document (`docs/CRM_GMAIL_FILTER_GUIDE_HANS.md`) containing:

1. Complete email subject line reference table for all 5 relevant languages (EN, NL, FR, FI, PL)
2. Hans's specific routing summary (what he receives vs. doesn't)
3. Step-by-step Gmail filter setup instructions with exact search queries
4. A test plan for verifying Finnish lead escalation

## File to Create

**`docs/CRM_GMAIL_FILTER_GUIDE_HANS.md`** — A single, self-contained markdown document with all the content from the user's message, formatted cleanly with proper markdown tables, headers, and code blocks for the Gmail search queries.

The document will follow the exact subject line format from the deterministic email subject standard (`CRM_NEW_LEAD_[LANG]`, `CRM_ADMIN_NO_CLAIM_[LANG]`, `CRM_ADMIN_CLAIMED_NOT_CALLED_[LANG]`) and the language routing configuration (Hans as fallback admin for FI and PL only).

No code changes required — this is purely a reference document.
