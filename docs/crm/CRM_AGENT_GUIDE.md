## Claiming Leads

### How Lead Distribution Works

1. When a new lead arrives, the system identifies eligible agents based on:
   - **Language match** - You must speak the lead's language
   - **Availability** - You must be marked as accepting new leads
   - **Capacity** - You must not be at your maximum lead limit

2. Eligible agents receive notifications via:
   - In-app notification (bell icon)
   - Email notification
   - Optional: Slack notification

3. You have **15 minutes** to claim the lead (claim window)

### Claiming a Lead

1. Click the notification or find the lead in "New Leads" section
2. Review the lead information:
   - Name, phone, email
   - Language
   - Budget and timeframe
   - Property preferences
3. Click **"Claim This Lead"**
4. The lead is now assigned to you

**Important:** 
- First click wins - if another agent clicks simultaneously, only one will succeed
- If no one claims within 15 minutes, the lead goes to the admin for manual assignment

### What Happens After Claiming

- The lead appears in your "My Leads" list
- Your lead count increases
- Other agents no longer see this lead
- You should contact the lead as soon as possible (SLA target: within 4 hours)
