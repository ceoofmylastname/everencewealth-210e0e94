        question: "What makes an independent broker different?",
        answer: "An independent broker works exclusively for you — not for any single insurance company. Unlike captive agents who can only sell their company's products, independent brokers have access to 75+ carriers, allowing unbiased product recommendations that truly fit your needs."
      },
      {
        question: "How much do I need to start working with a financial advisor?",
        answer: "At Everence Wealth, we work with clients at various stages of their financial journey. There's no minimum investment required for an initial consultation. Our planning services start at accessible price points, and investment management typically begins with portfolios of $50,000 or more."
      },
      {
        question: "What is an IUL and is it right for me?",
        answer: "An Indexed Universal Life (IUL) policy combines life insurance protection with cash value accumulation tied to a market index like the S&P 500. It offers tax-advantaged growth, downside protection, and flexible premiums. Whether it's right for you depends on your income, tax situation, and long-term goals."
      },
      {
        question: "How does tax-advantaged retirement planning work?",
        answer: "Tax-advantaged retirement planning uses accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and Roth accounts to reduce your current or future tax burden. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A balanced approach often works best."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need life insurance if I have no dependents?",
        answer: "Life insurance can still be valuable without dependents. Permanent policies like IUL build tax-advantaged cash value you can access during your lifetime. It can also be used for estate planning, charitable giving, or business succession planning."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I review my financial plan?",
        answer: "We recommend reviewing your financial plan at least annually, or whenever you experience a major life event such as marriage, divorce, job change, home purchase, or the birth of a child. Regular reviews ensure your strategy stays aligned with your evolving goals."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
        answer: "Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (10-30 years) at lower premiums but has no cash value. Whole life insurance provides permanent coverage with guaranteed cash value growth but costs more. The right choice depends on your protection needs and financial goals."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if I'm saving enough for retirement?",
        answer: "A general guideline is saving 15-20% of your gross income for retirement. However, the right amount depends on your desired retirement lifestyle, expected Social Security benefits, pension income, and retirement age. Our advisors can create a personalized retirement projection."
