        { q: "How does tax-free retirement income work?", a: "Certain financial instruments, like Roth IRAs and properly structured Index Strategies, allow you to withdraw funds tax-free in retirement. We help you build a multi-bucket strategy to minimize lifetime taxes." },
        { q: "Who is Everence Wealth best suited for?", a: "We primarily serve families and professionals between ages 35-60 who want to protect their wealth, optimize their tax situation, and build a reliable retirement income they won't outlive." },

        { q: "What is the retirement gap assessment?", a: "It's a complimentary analysis that compares your current trajectory against what you'll actually need in retirement. In five minutes, you'll see exactly where you stand and what adjustments could close the gap." },
